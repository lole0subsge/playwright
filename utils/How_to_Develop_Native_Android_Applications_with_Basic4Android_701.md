In this article, we will show you how to get started with B4A 7.01, the latest version of this amazing tool that was released in 2017. We will also introduce some of the new features and libraries that B4A 7.01 offers, such as USB host / accessory modes, Arduino ADK, libGDX, Google Play In-App Billing service, and more.
 
## Installing B4A 7.01
 
To install B4A 7.01, you need to download the setup file from the official website: [https://www.b4x.com/b4a.html](https://www.b4x.com/b4a.html). The setup file includes the B4A IDE, the B4A compiler, the B4A bridge app (for wireless debugging), and the core libraries. You can also download additional libraries from the website or from the online community forum: [https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/).
 
After downloading the setup file, run it and follow the instructions to install B4A on your computer. You will also need to install the Android SDK and Java JDK on your computer if you don't have them already. You can find detailed instructions on how to do that here: [https://www.b4x.com/b4a.html#installation](https://www.b4x.com/b4a.html#installation).
 
## Creating Your First App
 
To create your first app with B4A 7.01, launch the B4A IDE and click on File -> New -> New Project. Give your project a name and a package name (e.g., com.example.hello) and click on OK. You will see a blank code editor where you can write your app logic using the B4A programming language.
 
The B4A programming language is similar to Visual Basic or VB.NET, but it is 100% focused on Android development. It is an object-oriented language that supports variables, arrays, collections, classes, modules, subs (functions), events, properties, loops, conditional statements, operators, expressions, etc. You can find a complete reference guide to the language here: [https://www.b4x.com/b4a.html#language](https://www.b4x.com/b4a.html#language).
 
To write your first app, you need to add some code to the Main module of your project. The Main module is where your app starts and where you can initialize your global variables and objects. You can also create other modules for different parts of your app logic.
 
The first thing you need to do is to declare an Activity object that represents your app's main screen. An Activity is a container for views (such as buttons, labels, text boxes, etc.) that make up your app's user interface. You can create multiple activities for different screens of your app.
 
To declare an Activity object, add this line of code at the top of your Main module:
 `Dim Main As Activity` 
This creates a global variable named Main that holds a reference to an Activity object.
 
The next thing you need to do is to initialize your Main activity in the Activity\_Create event sub. This event sub is called when your activity is created for the first time. Here you can load your activity layout (the arrangement of views on your screen) and set up any other initialization code.
 
To initialize your Main activity, add this code below the variable declaration:
 `Sub Activity_Create(FirstTime As Boolean)` 
`Main.Initialize("")` 
`Activity.LoadLayout("Main")` 
`End Sub` <p 0f148eb4a0
